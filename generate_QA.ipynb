    "1. `repeat`: Same/synonymous verb + object pair with identical/no indirect relations  \n",
    "   (e.g., {\"verb\":\"place\", \"object\":\"wood\"} vs {\"verb\":\"put\", \"object\": \"wooden piece\")\n",

    "   (e.g., \"put wood (on table)\" vs \"place wood (on book)\")\n",
    "3. `unique`: No matching verb-object pairs in other actions from the set\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "1. Compare ALL action pairs across the entire dataset\n",
    "2. Consider indirect relations ONLY for 'check' determination\n",

Action 7: The verb-object pair (\"press\" and \"cardboard\") doesn\\'t match any other actions, so it\\'s labeled as \\'unique\\'.\\n2. Action 8: The verb-object pair (\"drop\" and \"cardboard\") is identical to Action 45, so it\\'s labeled as \\'repeat\\'.\\n3. Action 23: The verb-object pair (\"place\" and \"ruler\") doesn\\'t match any other actions, so it\\'s labeled as \\'unique\\'.\\n4. Action 25: The verb-object pair (\"adjust\" and \"ruler\") is different from the indirect relation in Actions 97 and 107, but similar to the verb-object pair in Action 23. Therefore, it\\'s labeled as \\'check\\'.\\n5. Action 33: The verb-object pair (\"pick\" and \"card\") doesn\\'t match any other actions, so it\\'s labeled as \\'unique\\'.\\n6. Action 38: The verb-object pair (\"pick up\" and \"cardboard\") is different from the indirect relation in Actions 52 and 95, but similar to the verb-object pair in Action 45. Therefore, it\\'s labeled as \\'check\\'.\\n7. Action 45: The verb-object pair (\"drop\" and \"cardboard\") matches Action 8, so it\\'s labeled as \\'repeat\\'.\\n8. Action 52: The verb-object pair (\"cut\" and \"cardboard\", with indirect relation) is different from the other actions, so it\\'s labeled as \\'unique\\'.\\n9. Action 64: The verb-object pair (\"arrange\" and \"cardboard\") doesn\\'t match any other actions, so it\\'s labeled as \\'unique\\'.\\n10. Action 81: The verb-object pair (\"drop\" and \"cutter\") doesn\\'t match any other actions, so it\\'s labeled as \\'unique\\'.\\n11. Action 84: The verb-object pair (\"clean off\" and \"cardboard\") doesn\\'t match any other actions, so it\\'s labeled as \\'unique\\'.\\n12. Action 95: The verb-object pair (\"cut\" and \"cardboard\", with indirect relation) is different from the other actions, but similar to Actions 52 and 107. Therefore, it\\'s labeled as \\'check\\'.\\n13. Action 97: The verb-object pair (\"cut\" and \"cardboard\", with indirect relation) is different from the other actions, so it\\'s labeled as \\'unique\\'.\\n14. Action 107: The verb-object pair (\"cut\" and \"cardboard\", with indirect relation) matches Actions 95 and 52, but has a different indirect relation. Therefore, it\\'s labeled as \\'check\\'.\\n15.
